# Please write a program which asks the user for a floating point number and then prints out the integer part and 
# the decimal part separately. Use the Python int function.

# You can assume the number given by the user is always greater than zero.

# An example of expected behaviour:

# Sample output
# Please type in a number: 1.34
# Integer part: 1
# Decimal part: 0.34

# Solution:

number = float(input("Please type in a number:"))

int_num = int(number)
decimal_num = number - int_num 

print(f"Integer part: {int_num}\nDecimal part: {decimal_num}")
